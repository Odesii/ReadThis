# READTHIS

## Description

Congratulations, you've found the instructions to my simple CLI app that generates readme files for your GitHub repositories.
It's about as straightforward as you'd expect, but I know you'll ask anyway.

## Installation

First things first, install Node. Yes, that's a prerequisite. Next, you'll need to install 'inquirer' and 'colors' from npm.
I trust you know how to use a package manager, or can at least pretend to.

## Usage

Open your terminal—yes, that scary window with all the text—and `cd` to your folder containing the index.
Run `node index.js` and just follow the prompts. It's not rocket science, I promise.
